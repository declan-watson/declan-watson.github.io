Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I haven't figured out a blog name or anything like that yet but may change some stuff around in the future.

For a bit more about me, see my [about](/about.html) page.

I've got some ideas for upcoming posts but will definitely be open to suggestions. I'm still sorting out other contact methods but at the moment you can message me on [Mastodon](www.infosec.exchange/@declan) or on [Github](www.github.com/declan-watson).

That's it for now, new posts coming soon!

Declan
