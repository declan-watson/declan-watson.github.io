I wrote this a while back but putting it up here as I'll likely need to reference it in some other writing.

---

I'm gonna try and reference this (cause of good old Brandolini's law) probably not overly cohesive rant/void scream and I've got no idea how long this will go for but let's go.

Trump and his oligarchy (or the oligarchs and their purchased Trump) are undoubtedly fascist [^1][^2][^3]. I could (and might? if I somehow get time) do a breakdown of examples from the Trump administration to the referenced lists but most of them should be obvious in how they apply.

As with every fascist movement, they will try and plead for 'civility' and make it sound like you need to put up with their existence to attain some misunderstood goal of pure tolerance; it's bullshit. They try and make it sound like they believe in 'free speech' as a ruse to push violence, as soon as they are in power any voice that doesn't fit the regime is crushed or disappeared like Mahmoud Khalil [^4][^5][^6] (or just disappeared for no reason like Kilmar Ábrego García and Merwil Gutiérrez). They don't believe in free speech, they believe in their own speech, regardless of whether it's lies or not [^7]. Often the lie is the point, it's intended as a display of power to show that they cannot be held accountable. Other times he is simply just that stupid and believes whatever ChatGPT tells him [^8].

From Karl Popper, back in 1945:
“If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.”

No society that conceded political space to fascism has ever improved in any way. The only thing that it allows is the further spread of violence and hate. "But that won't get rid of the problem, won't denying them space just push them underground?" Yep, and that's a good thing. I'd much rather them in their little basements with no national platform, compared to openly doing a nazi salute at a presidential inauguration.

It's going to be dangerous times in America for anyone who's not a straight, white, cis, Christian, guy. With the Overton window cranking a hard right it'll probably be dangerous for those that are politically anywhere left of Reagan.

While some commentators have noted that the 'culture war' aspect of the Trump campaign doesn't resonate as strongly in Australia, in favour of issues such as cost of living, I think this overlooks the similarities and assumes that everything that's done through the 'proper' method is right. There's many ideas the Liberals (and often Labor) share with Trump that are just delivered in a more palatable way. Incentives for investors hoarding property, tax cuts for the wealthy and the torture [^9] of people fleeing deadly situations being just some of them. That's not even mentioning the similarities in vehement opposition to science, by way of denying the existence of climate change, and other less headline-grabbing cyber issues like trying to dismantle encryption which keeps us safe. They lack the bluster, and are more tempered about it, but there's a lot of similarities in policy (especially when it comes to dealing with big businesses).

So why am I talking about Trump when I, as an Australian, are pretty far removed from the impacts of his presidency? For one, with a climate emergency, the brink of WWIII, and international trade relations, the Trump oligarchy absolutely impacts more than those just in America. Second, goes back to what I was saying before about not giving them legitimacy; fascism has to be called out for what it is. It has to be rebuked consistently and widely and I'm just adding my small part to that rebuke. Lastly, and it's a bit selfish, but I don't want anyone, particularly my daughter, as well as my family or friends, thinking that I'm apathetic to what's happening. I'm not willing to give fascism a chance.

Community is important and one of the key ways to combat fascism. Look after yourselves and look after each other, especially marginalised communities. Trans people and immigrants are specifically under attack at the moment but fascists will try and make people scared of anyone, which is why there's more than one line in the poem "first they came". We have a lot more in common with each other than they want us to believe, don't let them direct your anger or fear to the marginalised.

Be good to each other, be difficult for fascists.

Thanks for reading this far!
