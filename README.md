Husband, nerd and spreadsheet jockey from Sydney/Gadigal land.

Currently doing financial analysis but also interested in learning about technology and cybersecurity. I enjoy tinking with technology which is why I'm using Linux on my main computer (not that a beginner couldn't also use it) and using <a href="https://grapheneos.org/features">GrapheneOS</a> on my phone. I'm also particularly interested in digital privacy, I believe that not wanting to continuously share information with a company doesn't make you weird, just like closing your blinds so the creep across the street with binoculars can't see you doesn't make you weird. At the minumum you should be able to chose what information you provide and for what purpose.

I'm setting up this blog where I plan to write about things I'm learning in the tech space or current events. I'm just getting started for now so the whole site will likely be fleshed out a bit more in future.

In my free time I enjoy:
- Learning
  - Currently learning network and tech related stuff but also learning Mandarin
- Destiny 2
- Magic the Gathering
- D&D

The best way to contact me would be at the moment would be via [email](mailto:declan.watson@tuta.io) here (on my <a href="https://github.com/declan-watson">Github</a>) or <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@declan">Mastodon</a>.

My views do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, although I'm not planning on writing anything outlandish!
