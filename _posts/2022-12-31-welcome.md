Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I haven't figured out a blog name or anything like that yet but may change some stuff around in the future.

For a bit more about me, see my [about](/about.html) page.

I've got some ideas for upcoming posts but will definitely be open to suggestions. I'm still sorting out other contact methods but at the moment you can message me on [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@declan) or on [Github](https://github.com/declan-watson).

Update: You can now also [send me an email](mailto:declan.watson@tuta.io).

That's it for now, new posts coming soon!

Declan
